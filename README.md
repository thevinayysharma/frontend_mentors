### Useful resource
<hr>

- [codepen_solution](https://codepen.io/bobmatyas/pen/NWRWVeK?editors=1100) - This helped me to understand certain html tags. I really liked this approach and changed my div's to semantic-html tags using details & summary. 
- [repo_solution](https://github1s.com/catherineisonline/faq-accordion-card-frontendmentor/blob/HEAD/styles.css#L227) helped to understand how background images and webkit can be used instead of hardcoding into html-->
